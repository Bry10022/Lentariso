Here is the changelog of the Lentariso font. The latest version is at the top.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 1.012 - Released 06/11/2024

Changes
- Fixed U+1D46 as it looked the same as U+10783, when it should have been rotated 180 degrees; and U+10780 as it was a full-sized capital superscript, when it should have been small capital superscript. I can't believe that those went unnoticed until now.
